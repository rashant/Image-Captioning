The model is trained on flickr 8k dataset. The model follows the merging architecture and it is an LSTM model. The model has a BLEU score of 54.65%. It uses the pretrained VGG16 model for image feature extraction. The BLEU score can be increased by training the model for longer epochs and increasing the dataset, like using flickr 30k.
